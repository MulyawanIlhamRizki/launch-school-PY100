# Without running the following code, what do you think it will do?

def foo(bar, qux):
    print(bar)
    print(qux)

foo(42, 3.141592, 2.718)

# An error will occur.
# The function foo expects 2 arguments being passed to it
# The function call provides more than 2 arguments, thus positional error will occur

# Based on ex 7 & 8 we can conclude that function parameters and arguments quantity need to match
