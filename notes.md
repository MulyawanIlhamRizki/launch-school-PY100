# Notes

A collection of notes for this intro to python module, it grows as time  goes by.

## PEP8 - Styling python code

- Set your text editor to use four space characters (not tabs) for identation.
- Set your text editor to expand tab characters to spaces.
- Limit code lines and comments to 79 characters. 
- Use comments to leave notes for other programmers or themselves at a later point in time. However do not overdo it.
- Use multiple levels levels of identation, though you should avoid using more than two levels
- Use spaces between operators and operands to make your code less cluttered and easier to read.
