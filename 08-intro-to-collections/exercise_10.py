# Bob expects the following code to print the names in alphabetical order. 
# Without running the code, can you say whether it will? Explain your answer.

names = { 'Chris', 'Clare', 'Karis', 'Karl',
          'Max', 'Nick', 'Victor' }
print(names)

# Since the above collection type is a set. It will not print alphebetically.
# Sets are unordered, therefore it will not follow typical ordering.
