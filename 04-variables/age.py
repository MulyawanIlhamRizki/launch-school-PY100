# 
age = 22 # assignment (initialization)

# Use f-strings to provide the solution
print(f"You are {age} years old.")
print(f"In 10 years you will be {age + 10} years old.")
print(f"In 20 years you will be {age + 20} years old.")
print(f"In 30 years you will be {age + 30} years old.")
print(f"In 40 years you will be {age + 40} years old.")

print("-----------------------------------------------")
# Another way is to use concatenation and coercion
# Example:
print("In 10 years you will be " + str(age + 10) + " years old.")
