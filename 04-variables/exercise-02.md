# Classify the following potential FUNCTION names as *idiomatic, non-idiomatic, or illegal*. For the non-idiomatic and illegal names, explain your choice.

Function naming convention shares the same criteria as non-constant variable naming convention. Thus, the answer is the same and the reason also is the same.

|Name | Class | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- | 
| index | idiomatic | -
| CatName | non-idiomatic | use of PascalCase instead of snake_case
| lazy_dog | idiomatic | -
| quick_Fox | non-idiomatic | snake_case but with caps
| 1stCharacter | illegal | starts with number
| operand2 | idiomatic | -
| BIG_NUMBER | non-idiomatic | SNAKE_CASE is for constant
| π | non-idiomatic | π is not in ASCII table
