# To what value does the following expression evaluate?

"12" < "9"

# The expression above will return True
# Because the string comparison start from left to right
# Which means the first comparison is "1" < "9"
# Python will stop here as the expression above is True, it will not compare the rest

# To check my answer

print("12" < "9")
