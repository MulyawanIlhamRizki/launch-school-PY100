# Getting Started Solution

1. Create a directory named my_folder and navigate to that directory. Create two files named one.py and two.py in my_folder. Add the following Python code to one.py:

    - mkdir my_folder
    - cd my_folder
    - code one.py > print("This is file one")
    - code two.py > print("This is file one")
    - python3 one.py
    - python3 two.py

2. When you finish Exercise 1, navigate to the directory above the my_folder directory and delete all the content you generated in Exercise 1 with one command.

    - cd ..
    - rm -r my_folder
